Given a positive integer n, count the number of digits in n that divide n evenly (i.e., without leaving a remainder). Return the total number of such digits.
A digit d of n divides n evenly if the remainder when n is divided by d is 0 (n % d == 0).
Digits of n should be checked individually. If a digit is 0, it should be ignored because division by 0 is undefined.

class Solution:
  def cntdigit(self,n):
    N=str(n) #bcos int value cannot be used in for ro iterate so change to string
    cnt=0
    for i in N:
      if int(i)==0:
        continue
      elif int(N)%int(i)==0:
        cnt+=1
    return cnt
