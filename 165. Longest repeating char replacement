You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most k times.
Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.

from collections import Counter
class Solution(object):
    def characterReplacement(self, s, k):
        maxlen, largestCount = 0, 0
        arr = collections.Counter()
        for idx in range(len(s)):
            arr[s[idx]] += 1
            largestCount = max(largestCount, arr[s[idx]])
            if maxlen - largestCount >= k:
                arr[s[idx - maxlen]] -= 1
            else:
                maxlen += 1
        return maxlen
