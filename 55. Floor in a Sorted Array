Given a sorted array arr[] and an integer x, find the index (0-based) of the largest element in arr[] that is less than or equal to x. This element is called the floor of x. 
If such an element does not exist, return -1.Note: In case of multiple occurrences of ceil of x, return the index of the last occurrence.

def flrsort(self,arr,x):
  hi = len(arr)-1
  low = 0
  ans = -1
  while lo < hi:
    mid = (lo+hi)//2
    if arr[mid] == x:
      return mid
    elif arr[mid] < x:
      ans = mid
      lo = mid+1
    else:
      hi = mid-1
  return ans
