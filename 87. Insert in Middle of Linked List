Given the head of a Singly Linked List and a value x. The task is to insert the key in the middle of the linked list.

class Solution:
    def insertInMiddle(self, head, x):
        if head is None:
            return Node(x)

        new_node = Node(x)
        curr_node = head
        length = 0
        while curr_node is not None:
            length += 1
            curr_node = curr_node.next

        mid = length // 2 if length % 2 == 0 else (length + 1) // 2
        curr_node = head
        while mid > 1:
            curr_node = curr_node.next
            mid -= 1
        new_node.next = curr_node.next
        curr_node.next = new_node

        return head
