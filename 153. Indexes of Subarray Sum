Given an array arr[] containing only non-negative integers, your task is to find a continuous subarray (a contiguous sequence of elements) whose sum equals a specified value target. 
You need to return the 1-based indices of the leftmost and rightmost elements of this subarray. You need to find the first subarray whose sum is equal to the target.

Note: If no such array is possible then, return [-1].

class Solution:
    def subarraySum(self, arr, target):
        ind,s=0,0
        for i in range(len(arr)):
            s+=arr[i]
            while s>target:
                s-=arr[ind]
                ind+=1                                           
            if s==target:
                return(ind+1,i+1)         
        return [-1]
