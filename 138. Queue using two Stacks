Implement a Queue using 2 stacks s1 and s2 .
A Query q is of 2 Types
(i) 1 x (a query of this type means  pushing 'x' into the queue)
(ii) 2   (a query of this type means to pop element from queue and print the poped element)
Note : If there is no element return -1 as answer while popping.

def Push(x,stack1,stack2):
    stack1.append(x)
    return
#Function to pop an element from queue by using 2 stacks.
def Pop(stack1,stack2):
    if not stack2:
        while stack1:
            stack2.append(stack1.pop())
    if not stack2:
        return -1
    return stack2.pop()
    
    '''
    stack1: list
    stack2: list
    '''
