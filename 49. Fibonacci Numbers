Given a non-negative integer n, your task is to find the nth Fibonacci number.The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence where the next term is the sum of the previous two terms.
The first two terms of the Fibonacci sequence are 0 followed by 1. The Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21

def nthfib(self,n):
  if n<=1:
    return n          #to only get nth number
  else:
    return self.nthfib(n-1)+self.nthfib(n-2)


def fibonacciNumbers(self,n):
        fib_sequence = []
        if n <= 0:
            return fib_sequence
        elif n == 1:
            return [0]                  #to get sequence till n
        elif n == 2:
            return [0, 1]
        fib_sequence = [0, 1]
        for i in range(2, n):
            next_fib = fib_sequence[i - 1] + fib_sequence[i - 2]
            fib_sequence.append(next_fib)
        return fib_sequence
