A celebrity is a person who is known to all but does not know anyone at a party. A party is being organized by some people. A square matrix mat[][] (n*n) is used to represent people at the party such that if an element of row i and column j is set to 1 it means ith person knows jth person. You need to return the index of the celebrity in the party, 
if the celebrity does not exist, return -1.

class Solution:
    def celebrity(self, mat):
        n = len(mat)
        i = 0
        j = n - 1
        while i < j:
            if mat[j][i] == 1:
                j -= 1
            else:
                i += 1
        c = i
        for i in range(n):
            if i == c:
                continue
            if mat[c][i] or not mat[i][c]:
                return -1
        return c
