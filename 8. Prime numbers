Given a number n, determine whether it is a prime number or not. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

def isPrime(self,n):
    if n<=1:
        return False
    for i in range(2,n//2):
        if n%i==0:
            return False
            break
    return True
