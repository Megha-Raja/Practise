You are given an array arr[] containing positive integers. The elements in the array arr[] range from 1 to n (where n is the size of the array), and some numbers may be repeated or absent. 
Your task is to count the frequency of all numbers in the range 1 to n and return an array of size n such that result[i] represents the frequency of the number i (1-based indexing).

def freqcnt(self,arr):
  d={}
  r=[]
  for i in range(len(arr)):
    if arr[i] not in d:
      d[arr[i]]=1
    else:
      d[arr[i]]+=1
  for i in range(1,len(arr)+1):
    if i not in d.keys():
      r.append(0)
    else:
      r.append(d[i])
  return r
