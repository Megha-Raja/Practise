Given an array arr[] of n weights. Find the least weight capacity of a boat to ship all weights within d days.
The ith weight has a weight of arr[i]. Each day, we load the boat with weights given by arr[i].We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.
Note: You have to load weights on the boat in the given order.

def subarray(self,arr,maxcap):
  s=len(arr)
  total=0
  count=1
  for num in arr:
    if total+num > maxcap:
      count+=1
      total=num
    else:
      total+=num
  return count
def minweight(self,arr,n ,d):
  if d > n:
    return -1
  lo=max(arr)
  hi=sum(arr)
  while lo<hi:
    mid=(lo+hi)//2
    count = self.subarray(arr,mid)
    if count>d:
      lo=mid+1
    else:
      hi=mid-1
  return lo
