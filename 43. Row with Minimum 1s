Given a 2D binary matrix(1-based indexed) mat of dimensions nxm , determine the row that contains the minimum number of 1's.
Note: The matrix contains only 1's and 0's. Also, if two or more rows contain the minimum number of 1's, the answer is the lowest of those indices.

def minrow(self,a):
  ind=0
  min_ones = sum(arr[0])
  for i in range(len(a)):
    min_cnt=sum(a[i])
    if min_cnt < min_ones:
      ind,min_ones=i,min_cnt
  return ind+1
