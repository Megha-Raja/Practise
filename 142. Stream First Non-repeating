Given an input stream s consisting only of lowercase alphabets. While reading characters from the stream, you have to tell which character has appeared only once in the stream upto that point. If there are many characters that have appeared only once, you have to tell which one of them was the first one to appear. 
If there is no such character then append '#' to the answer.

from collections import deque, defaultdict
class Solution:
    def FirstNonRepeating(self, A):
        q = deque()
        freq = defaultdict(int)
        result = []
    
        # Iterate over each character 
        for ch in A:
            q.append(ch)
            freq[ch] += 1
        
            # Remove characters from the front of the queue until a frequency of 1
            while q and freq[q[0]] > 1:
                q.popleft()
        
            # If the queue is empty, append '#' 
            if not q:
                result.append('#')
            else:
                result.append(q[0])
    
        return ''.join(result)
