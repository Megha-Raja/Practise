Given a string s and an integer k, the task is to reduce the string by applying the following operation:
Choose a group of k consecutive identical characters and remove them.

The operation can be performed any number of times until it is no longer possible.

class Solution:
    def Reduced_String(self, k, s):
        stk = []
        i = 0
        while i < len(s):
            ch = s[i]
            i += 1
            stk.append(ch)
            count = 0
            # Count the number of consecutive occurrences of current character
            while len(stk) > 0 and stk[-1] == ch:
                count += 1
                stk.pop()
            if count == k:
                continue
            else:
                # Otherwise, push back the characters that were popped
                while count > 0:
                    stk.append(ch)
                    count -= 1
        result = ""
        while len(stk) > 0:
            result = stk.pop() + result
        return result
