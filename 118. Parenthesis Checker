Given a string s, composed of different combinations of '(' , ')', '{', '}', '[', ']', verify the validity of the arrangement.
An input string is valid if:

         1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
         2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

lass Solution:
    def isBalanced(self, s):
        # code here
        n = len(s)
        stack = []
        for i in range(n):
            curr = s[i]
            if curr == '(' or curr == '{' or curr == '[':
                stack.append(curr)
            else:
                if not stack:
                    return False
                else:
                    top = stack[-1]
                    stack.pop()
                    if (curr == ')' and top != '(') or (curr == '}' and top != '{') or (curr == ']' and top != '['):
                        return False

        return True if len(stack) == 0 else False
