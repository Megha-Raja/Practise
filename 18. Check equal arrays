Given two arrays a[] and b[] of equal size, the task is to find whether the elements in the arrays are equal.
Two arrays are said to be equal if both contain the same set of elements, arrangements (or permutations) of elements may be different though.

def checkEqual(self,a,b):
  a.sort()
  b.sort()
  if a==b:
    return True
  return False
