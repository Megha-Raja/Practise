Given a singly linked list. The task is to remove duplicates (nodes with duplicate values) from the given list (if it exists).
Note: Try not to use extra space. The nodes are arranged in a sorted way.

def removeDuplicates(head):
    while head.next:
        if head.data==head.next.data:
            head.next=head.next.next
        else:
            head=head.next
    return head
