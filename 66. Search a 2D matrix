Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value target in an m x n integer matrix matrix. This matrix has the following properties:
Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.

def search(self,mat,target):
  row=len(mat)
  col=len(mat[0])
  i=row-1
  j=0
  while i>=0 and j<col:
    if mat[i][j]==target:
      return True
    elif mat[i][j]<target:
      j+=1
    else:
      i-=1
  return False
