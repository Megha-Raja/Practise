Given a sorted array arr with possibly some duplicates, the task is to find the first and last occurrences of an element x in the given array.
Note: If the number x is not found in the array then return both the indices as -1.

def firlasocc(self,arr,x):
  n  =  len(arr)
  k = []
  for i in range(n)
    if arr[i] == x:
      k.append(i)
  if k:
    return (k[0],k[-1])
  else:
    return [-1,-1]
