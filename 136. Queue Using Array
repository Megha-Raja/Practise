Implement a Queue using an Array. Queries in the Queue are of the following type:
(i) 1 x   (a query of this type means  pushing 'x' into the queue)
(ii) 2     (a query of this type means to pop an element from the queue and print the popped element. If the queue is empty then return -1)

We just have to implement the functions push and pop and the driver code will handle the output.

from collections import deque
class MyQueue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.q = []
    
    def push(self, x):
        self.q.append(x)
        
    def pop(self): 
        if len(self.q)==0:
            return -1
        return self.q.pop(0)
