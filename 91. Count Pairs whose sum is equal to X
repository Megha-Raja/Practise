Given two linked lists head1 and head2 with distinct elements, determine the count of all distinct pairs from both lists whose sum equals the given value x.
Note: A valid pair would be in the form (x, y) where x is from the first linked list and y is from the second linked list. (1, 3) and (3, 1) are considered different.

class Solution:
    def countPairs(self, head1, head2, x):
        count = 0;    
        us = set() 
        while (head1 != None):   
            us.add(head1.data);    
            head1 = head1.next;
        while (head2 != None):  
            if ((x - head2.data) in us):
                count += 1
            head2 = head2.next;    
        return count;
