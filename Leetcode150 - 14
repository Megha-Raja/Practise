There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

class Solution:
    def candy(self, ratings: List[int]) -> int:
        n=len(ratings)
        tot_cand=n
        i=1
        while i<n:
            if ratings[i]==ratings[i-1]:
                i+=1
                continue
            cur_peak=0
            while i<n and ratings[i]>ratings[i-1]:
                cur_peak+=1
                tot_cand+=cur_peak
                i+=1
            if i==n:
                return tot_cand
            cur_val=0
            while i<n and ratings[i]<ratings[i-1]:
                cur_val+=1
                tot_cand+=cur_val
                i+=1
            tot_cand-=min(cur_peak,cur_val)
        return tot_cand
