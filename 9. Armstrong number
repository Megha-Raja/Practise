You are given a 3-digit number n, Find whether it is an Armstrong number or not.
An Armstrong number of three digits is a number such that the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself. 371 is an Armstrong number since 33 + 73 + 13 = 371. 

def armstrong(self,n):
  sum=0
  n=str(n)
  for i in n:
    sum+=int(i)**3
  if sum==int(n):
    return True
  return False
