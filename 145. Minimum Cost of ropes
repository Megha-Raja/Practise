Given an array, arr[] of rope lengths, connect all ropes into a single rope with the minimum total cost. The cost to connect two ropes is the sum of their lengths. 

import heapq
from typing import List
class Solution:
    #Function to return the minimum cost of connecting the ropes.
    def minCost(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        heapq.heapify(arr)
        tc=0
        while len(arr)>1:
            first=heapq.heappop(arr)
            sec=heapq.heappop(arr)
            cost=first+sec
            tc+=cost
            heapq.heappush(arr,cost)
        return tc
