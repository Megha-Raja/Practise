You are given an array with unique elements of stalls[], which denote the position of a stall. You are also given an integer k which denotes the number of aggressive cows. 
Your task is to assign stalls to k cows such that the minimum distance between any two of them is the maximum possible.

def cows(self,stalls,k):
  stalls.sort()
  start=1
  end=stalls[-1]-stalls[0]
  while start<=end:
    mid=(start+end)//2
    cowcnt=1
    prev_pos=stalls[0]
    for i in range(1,len(arr)):
      if stalls[i]-prev_pos>=mid:
        cowcnt+=1
        prev_pos=arr[i]
      if cowcnt>=k:
        ans=mid
        start=mid+1
      else:
        end=mid-1
  return ans
