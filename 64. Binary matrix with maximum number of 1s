Given a binary matrix (containing only 0 and 1) of order NxN. All rows are sorted already, We need to find the row number with the maximum number of 1s. 
Also, find the number of 1s in that row.

def max1(self,mat,n):
  maxcnt=0
  ind=0
  for i in range(n):
    cnt=mat[i].count(1)
    if cnt>maxcnt:
      maxcnt=cnt
      ind=i
  return [ind,maxcnt]
