Print numbers from 1 to n without the help of loops. You only need to complete the function printNos() that takes n as a parameter and prints the number from 1 to n recursively.
Note: Don't print any newline, it will be added by the driver code.

def printNo(self,n):
  if n>0:
    self.printNo(n-1)
    print(n,end=" ")
