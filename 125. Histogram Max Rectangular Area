You are given a histogram represented by an array arr, where each element of the array denotes the height of the bars in the histogram. All bars have the same width of 1 unit.
Your task is to find the largest rectangular area possible in the given histogram, where the rectangle can be formed using a number of contiguous bars.

class Solution:
    def getMaxArea(self,arr):
        n = len(arr)
        right = [n]*n
        
        stack = []
        for i,e in enumerate(arr):
            while stack and arr[stack[-1]] > arr[i]:
                right[stack.pop()] = i
            stack.append(i)
        
        #print(right)
        stack = []
        left = [-1]*n
        for i in range(len(arr)-1, -1, -1):
            while stack and arr[stack[-1]] > arr[i]:
                left[stack.pop()] = i
            stack.append(i)
        
        #print(left)
        ans = 0
        for i in range(n):
            w = right[i]-left[i] - 1
            ans = max(ans, arr[i]*w)
        return ans
