You are given an array arr of size n - 1 that contains distinct integers in the range from 1 to n (inclusive). This array represents a permutation of the integers from 1 to n with one element missing. 
Your task is to identify and return the missing element.

def mis(self,arr):
  n = len(arr)+1
  total_sum = n*(n+1)//2
  arr_sum = sum(arr)
  miss = total_sum-arr_sum
  return miss
