Given an array of distinct elements which was initially sorted. This array may be rotated at some unknown point. 
The task is to find the minimum element in the given sorted and rotated array. 

def minsorted(self,arr,high,low):
  low=0
  high=len(arr)-1
  while low<=high:
    if arr[low]<arr[high]:
      return arr[low]
    mid=(low+high)//2
    if arr[mid]>arr[high]:
      low=mid+1
    else:
      high=mid
  return arr[low]
